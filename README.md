# Project_alpha

This project is named **project_alpha**. It is developed and tested with **Python 3**, version **3.9.6**.

## Requirements

Make sure you have Python 3.9.6 installed to run this project.

## Installation

A. Clone the repository to your local machine.

B. From inside the project_alpha directory, install the necessary dependencies with:

```zsh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the app:

### Obs:
I have added an empty folder to "stock_price_data_files" in order to highlight that the app detects this then skips it.
